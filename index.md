# My Ideas list:

- [ ] Provide mental health support using twitter and twitter screenshots across other social media platforms.
- [ ] Create a landing page for social audio app called mindspace(a mental health app that provides a safe space for men), particularly for men.
- [ ] Develop a social audio app that serves the above purpose.
- [ ] Fetch videos and imagery that provides mental health support from twitter API.
- [ ] Host twitter spaces that has application forms to participate in a show called #WhoKnosWhoKnows?
- [ ] Host Twitter spaces that is a safe space for men to give and provide advice(open mic).
- [ ] Suggest a twitter feature that displays a profile pop-up when clicking avi on the timeline before visiting actual profile.
- [ ] Suggest a feature where hosts can change voice in case a speaker wants to remain anonymous.
- [ ] For my portfolio I want to create should include the social audio app, restaurant website, interior design website, and a career section.
